# Repository Description  

This repository contains the source code for the paper:  
​**​"Graph Transformer Model Integrating Physical Features for Projected Electronic Density of States Prediction"​**.  

## Included Models  
The code implements four models:  
- ​**CGCNN**​  
- ​**CGAT**​  
- ​**CGT**​  
- ​**CGT-phys**​  

## Framework Dependency  
The graph neural network (GNN) models are built on the ​**​[PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)​**​ framework.  

## Support
