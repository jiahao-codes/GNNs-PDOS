​**​"Graph Transformer Model Integrating Physical Features for Projected Electronic Density of States Prediction"​**.  

## Included Models  
The code implements four models:  
- ​**CGCNN**​  
- ​**CGAT**​  
- ​**CGT**​  
- ​**CGT-phys**​  

## Framework Dependency  
All GNN models are built upon the ​frameworks from **​[PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)​**​ .
